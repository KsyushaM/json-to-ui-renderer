## Comments

- Each component should have default set of props in case there there is no props in json.
- Another way to build button is to customise current ButtonSelect component and include default styles with > icon. Depends on the application.
- ButtonSelect component may be a part of the ButtonSelectGroup where buttons selection state would be managed.
